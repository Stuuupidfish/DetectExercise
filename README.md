please download the file labeled "Pose landmarker (Full)" from [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/pose_landmarker/pose_landmarker_full/float16/latest/pose_landmarker_full.task) and then put it in this folder for it to work

for full transparency the pushup detection is my own work. The pose landmark setup was half copy pasted from the documentation and half vibecoded lol
